    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April 5, 2025</p>

    <p>This website, <strong>aasifanwer.github.io</strong>, may contain affiliate links. That means I may earn a small commission if you click through and make a purchase—at no extra cost to you.</p>

    <h2>1. Why Affiliate Links?</h2>
    <p>I use affiliate links to help support the content, hosting, and resources provided on this website. These earnings help keep the site running and free to access.</p>

    <h2>2. No Extra Cost to You</h2>
    <p>If you purchase something through an affiliate link, you won’t pay a penny more. In fact, in some cases, you may even get an exclusive discount.</p>

    <h2>3. Honest Recommendations</h2>
    <p>All affiliate products and services recommended here are based on personal experience, research, or trust in the brand. I only promote what I believe in and would use myself.</p>

    <h2>4. Transparency Matters</h2>
    <p>I’m committed to being fully transparent with my audience. If a post includes affiliate links, I’ll let you know either at the top or within the content.</p>

    <h2>5. Amazon Affiliate</h2>
    <p>As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. Amazon and the Amazon logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.</p>
